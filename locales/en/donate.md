The rahvaalgatus.ee platform has been launched by public money, but we need the support of users in order to maintain it and to ensure quality, discussions and initiatives. Contributions of any amount will be helpful, whether of 5, 50 or 500 euros. The collected money will help cover the costs related to digital signing, to secure technical support and security and help towards advising the authors of discussions and initiatives. Transparency is of great importance for us. We issue the names of major contributors and provide an overview of our activities.
